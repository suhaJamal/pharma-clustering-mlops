# DS04-Team-Project
This is the project for the team DS 04. 

Team-04 has chosen to analyze the 'Pharmaceutical Drug Spending by Countries' dataset.   


Our Question:
What are the clusters among countries in terms of pharmaceutical spending (as a percentage of health spending, percentage of GDP, and per capita spending), and how do these patterns relate to total spending across different years and inform market entry strategies?


Our audience:
Citizens of the respective countries we are analyzing in the dataset. Additionally, this analysis would also be available for regulatory agencies, think-tank organizations and governments.


Business Motivation:
Our core motivation is to understand the clusters of countries based on their overall pharmaceutical spending by analyzing it as a percentage of health spending and percentage of GDP and per capita spending. 

We want to understand the breakdown and see if our hypothesis that high income countries will be clustered with other high spending countries while middle and low income countries will be clustered with other similar countries. We also predict that the United States will be amoung the highest (if not the highest) spender because the pharmaceutical industry has spent very high sums in the US market on R&D and new medicinal development.


If team wants to add:
We also want to understand if there are any patterns in the OECD and non-OECD countries and if COVID-19 played a part in increasing pharmaceutical spending in all of the countries of our analysis.


Risks or Unknowns:
At this point we see one risk emerging from our analysis, incompleteness. For certain countries, data is missing for several years and is often sporadically missing. Therefore, we will narrow down the dataset to include only those countries whose data we have completely available from 20xx to 20xx.  

We will be analyzing the following countries in our dataset:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
6)
7)

There are not any unknowns that we have identified. We will do a comprehensive analysis of our question and if any unknowns later turn into knowns, we will state them in our analysis.
